# Municipality-Contracts-Audit-Portfolio-Project
This project analyzes 500 municipal contracts worth a combined R12.6 billion to uncover potential fraud, mismanagement, and irregular spending. Using Power BI, I developed a fully interactive dashboard that enables executives, auditors, and oversight bodies to identify high-risk vendors, track budget compliance, and monitor overall contract health.
